                    was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884 and briefly
                    worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those
                    to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the "Tesla coil,"
                    is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on January 7, 1943.</p>

            <div class="para">
                <p><img src="D:\practicehtml\Tribute-Tesla\Images\tesla young.jpg" style="border-radius: 50%;">Nikola
                    Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan, Croatia. Tesla's interest in electrical
                    invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her
                    spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest and a writer,
                    and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the
                    sciences. After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber
                    Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague
                    during the 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central Telephone
                    Exchange. It was while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but
                    after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave
                    Europe for America.</p>
            </div>
            <h4 style="clear: both;">FAMED INVENTOR</h4>
            <div class="para">
                <p><img src="D:\practicehtml\Tribute-Tesla\Images\presentation.jpg" style="border-radius: 28%;">In 1884
                    Tesla arrived the United States with little more than the clothes on his back and a letter of
                    introduction to famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works
                    were fast becoming the standard in the country. Edison hired Tesla, and the two men were soon
                    working tirelessly alongside each other, making improvements to Edison's inventions. However,
                    several months later, the two parted ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship,
                    attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a power
                    figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-tune and
                    somewhat vulnerable. After parting ways with Edison, in 1885 Tesla received funding for the Tesla
                    Electric Light Company and was tasked by his investors to develop improved arc lighting. After
                    successfully doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the venture and for a time had to work as a
                    manual laborer in order to survive. His luck changed in 1887, when he was able to find interest in
                    his AC electrical system and funding for his new Tesla Electric Company. Setting straight to work,
                    by the end of the year, Tesla had successfully filed several patents for AC-based inventions.
                    Tesla's AC system eventually caught the attention of American engineer and business man George
                    Westinghouse, who was seeking a solution to supplying the nation with long-distance power. Convinced
                    that Tesla's inventions would help him achieve this, in 1888 he purchased his patents for $60,000 in
                    cash and stock in the Westinghouse Corporation. As interest in an alternating-current system grew,
                    Tesla and Westinghouse were put in direct competition with Thomas Edison, who was intent on selling
                    his direct-current system to the nation. A negative-press campaign was soon waged by Edison, in an
                    attempt to undermine interest in AC power. Tesla, for his part, continued in his work and would
                    patent several more inventions during this period, including the "Tesla coil," which laid the
                    foundation for wireless technologies and is still used in radio technology today. Unfortunately for
                    Thomas Edison, the Westinghouse Corporation was chosen to supply the lighting at the 1893 World's
                    Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and Tesla conducted demonstrations of his AC system there. Two
                    years later, in 1895, Tesla designed what was among the first AC hydroelectric power plants in the
                    United States, at Niagara Falls. The following year, it was used to power the city of Buffalo, New
                    York, a feat that was highly publicized throughout the world. With its repeat successes and
                    favorable press, the alternating-current system would quickly become the preeminent power system of
                    the 20th century, and it has remained the worldwide standard ever since. In addition to his AC
                    system and coil, throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for a number
                    of other important inventions—most of which were officially patented by other inventors—including
                    dynamos (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer
                    in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic
                    field—the basis of most AC machinery.</p>

            <h4 style="clear: both;">THE FALL FROM GRACE</h4>
            <div class="para">
                <p><img src="D:\practicehtml\Tribute-Tesla\Images\Nikola_Tesla old.jpg"
                        style="border-radius: 30%;">Having become obsessed with the wireless transmission of energy,
                    around 1900 Nikola set to work on his boldest project yet: to build a global, wireless communication
                    system—to be transmitted through a large electrical tower—for sharing information and providing free
                    electricity throughout the world. With funding from a group of investors that included financial
                    giant J. P. Morgan, in 1901 Tesla began work on the project in earnest, designing and building a lab
                    with a power plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island, New York, that became
                    known as Wardenclyffe. However, when doubts arose among his investors about the plausibility of
                    Tesla's system and his rival, Guglielmo Marconi—with the financial support of Andrew Carnegie and
                    Thomas Edison—continued to make great advances with his own radio technologies, Tesla had no choice
                    but to abandon the project. The Wardenclyffe staff was laid off in 1906 and by 1915 the site had
                    fallen into foreclosure. Two years later Tesla declared bankruptcy and the tower was dismantled and
                    sold for scrap to help pay the debts he had accrued.</p>
            </div>
            <h4 style="clear: both;"> DEATH AND LEGACY</h4>
            <div class="para">
                <p><img src="D:\practicehtml\Tribute-Tesla\Images\death.jpg" style="border-radius: 30%;">After suffering
                    a nervous breakdown, Tesla eventually returned to work, primarily as a consultant. But as time went
                    on, his ideas became progressively more outlandish and impractical. He also grew increasingly
                    eccentric, devoting much of his time to the care of wild pigeons in New York City's parks. He even
                    drew the attention of the FBI with his talk of building a powerful "death beam," which had received
                    some interest from the Soviet Union during World World II. Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on
                    January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, in New York City, where he had lived for nearly 60 years. But the
                    legacy of the work he left behind him lives on to this day.</p>
